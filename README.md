# Werfa System  

## Project for Internet Programing I course 

### Static Web-Based Queue Management Prototype

##  Project Overview

The current manual queuing method requires students to stand in long lines for several hours, leading to wasted time, stress, and physical discomfort. This system introduces a simple digital workflow where:

- Students register online and receive a queue number instantly.
- Admins manage the queue through a dashboard.
- The system simulates real-time behavior using static pages.

Although the prototype does not include backend integration, it models how a complete system would function in a real environment.

### **General Objective**
To design and develop a static web-based prototype of the Werfa System.

### **Specific Objectives**
- Create a user-friendly interface.
- Automatically generate unique queue numbers.
- Implement separate interfaces for students and admins.
- Provide an admin dashboard for queue control.
- Ensure smooth navigation and fast loading.
- Apply basic input validation.
- Prepare the system for future backend expansion.
- Follow SDLC and RAD development principles.
  
##  Key Features

### **1. Role-Based Access**
- Landing page allows users to choose Student or Admin.

### **2. Student Interface**
- Register using name and ID.
- Instantly receive a queue number.
- View current serving number and estimated waiting time.

### **3. Admin Interface**
- Simulated login page.
- Dashboard displays all registered students.
- “Next” button to call and progress the queue.

### **4. Simple, Clean UI**
- Responsive and easy-to-use interface suitable for both students and admins.

### **5. Prototype Workflow**
- All functions run in the front-end only.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**
- **RAD (Rapid Application Development) model**
- **Static Web Technologies Only**

## Limitations

- No real database (data disappears on refresh)
- No real login authentication
- No automated notifications (SMS/email)
- No real-time updates
- Static prototype (front-end only)

These limitations are intentional for the academic prototype.

Geographical Coverage

- **Primary Site:** Hope Enterprise University College, Addis Ababa  
- **Target Users:** Students and administrators  
- **Potential Expansion:** Universities across Ethiopia  
- **Environment:** Campus network or local deployment  

## Future Enhancements

- Add **database** 
- Implement **real-time queue updates**
- Add **secure login system**
- Integrate **SMS/Email notifications**
- Develop **mobile app version**
- Connect to **cloud backend**
